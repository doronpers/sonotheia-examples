# Indicator Configuration
# 
# This file contains parameters for acoustic indicator computation.
# These are EXAMPLE values for research and evaluation purposes only.
# 
# Users can customize these parameters or add their own proprietary indicators
# through the plugin system.

# Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) Configuration
stft:
  # Number of samples per FFT segment
  # At 16kHz, 2048 samples = 128ms window
  # Larger values = better frequency resolution, worse time resolution
  # Example range: 512-4096 depending on use case
  nperseg: 2048
  
  # Number of overlapping samples between segments
  # Typically 50% of nperseg for good time-frequency balance
  noverlap: 1024
  
  # Window function for STFT
  # Options: 'hann', 'hamming', 'blackman', etc.
  window: "hann"

# Spectral Indicator Configuration
spectral:
  # Rolloff percentage (0-1)
  # Frequency below which this percentage of energy is contained
  # Example: 0.85 means 85% of energy
  rolloff_percent: 0.85
  
  # Minimum power threshold for frequency bins
  # Prevents log(0) errors and filters out noise floor
  min_power_threshold: 1.0e-10

# Perturbation Processing Configuration
perturbation:
  # Threshold to detect silent audio (power level)
  silent_audio_threshold: 1.0e-10
  
  # Reference power for silent audio SNR calculations
  # Used when actual signal power is below threshold
  silent_audio_reference_power: 1.0e-8
  
  # Small epsilon value to prevent numerical issues
  epsilon: 1.0e-10
