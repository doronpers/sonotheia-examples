# Threshold Configuration
# 
# This file contains threshold values for deferral policy decisions.
# These are EXAMPLE values for research and evaluation purposes only.
# 
# Users should tune these values based on their specific use case, domain,
# and tolerance for false positives/negatives.

# Deferral Policy Thresholds
deferral_policy:
  # Fragility threshold (coefficient of variation)
  # Indicators with CV > threshold are considered fragile
  # Higher values = more tolerant to variation (fewer deferrals)
  # Lower values = more sensitive to variation (more deferrals)
  # Example range: 0.2-0.5 depending on domain
  fragility_threshold: 0.3
  
  # Clipping detection threshold (amplitude ratio)
  # Audio with peak amplitude > threshold is considered clipped
  # Example range: 0.90-0.99
  clipping_threshold: 0.95
  
  # Minimum slice duration (seconds)
  # Slices shorter than this are marked as insufficient evidence
  # Example range: 0.3-1.0 seconds
  min_duration: 0.5
  
  # Minimum mean threshold for CV calculation
  # Values below this use robust metrics instead of CV
  # This prevents division by near-zero values
  min_mean_threshold: 1.0e-10

# Temporal Consistency Thresholds
consistency:
  # Threshold for relative change between slices
  # Changes > threshold indicate temporal inconsistency
  # Higher values = more tolerant to variation
  # Example range: 0.3-0.7
  threshold: 0.5
  
  # Minimum value threshold for relative change calculation
  # Values below this use alternative robust metrics
  min_value_threshold: 1.0e-10
