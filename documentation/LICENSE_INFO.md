# License Information

## MIT License - Why It's Right for This Repository

This repository is licensed under the **MIT License**, which is an excellent choice for the following reasons:

### What This Repository Contains

The `sonotheia-examples` repository contains:
- **Example code** for integrating with the Sonotheia API
- **Documentation** and best practices guides
- **Reference implementations** in multiple programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Node.js, cURL)
- **Integration patterns** for production deployments

This repository does **NOT** contain:
- The Sonotheia API service itself (which is proprietary)
- Any proprietary algorithms or detection models
- Production-ready SDKs (these are reference examples)

### Why MIT License is Appropriate

The MIT License is ideal for this repository because:

1. **Maximum Flexibility for Users**
   - Users can freely copy, modify, and integrate the example code into their own projects
   - No restrictions on commercial use - businesses can use these examples without legal concerns
   - Can be integrated into projects with different licenses (MIT is highly compatible)

2. **Encourages Adoption**
   - Low barrier to entry - developers can experiment freely
   - No copyleft requirements (unlike GPL) that might deter commercial users
   - Simple, well-understood license that legal teams recognize

3. **Industry Standard for Examples**
   - Most API provider example repositories use permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD)
   - Aligns with common practices for developer resources
   - Examples from AWS, Google Cloud, Stripe, and similar services use permissive licenses

4. **Minimal Liability**
   - "AS IS" warranty disclaimer protects the repository owner
   - Users understand these are examples, not production-guaranteed code
   - Appropriate for reference implementations

5. **Compatible Dependencies**
   - All dependencies in this repository are MIT or similarly permissive licensed:
     - Python: `requests`, `pytest` (Apache/MIT)
     - Node.js: `express`, `axios`, `pino` (MIT)
     - TypeScript: Standard MIT-licensed tooling
   - No GPL or other copyleft dependencies that would impose additional restrictions

### What Users Can Do

Under the MIT License, users of this repository can:

✅ **Use** the code in their own projects (commercial or non-commercial)
✅ **Modify** the examples to fit their specific needs
✅ **Distribute** modified or unmodified versions
✅ **Include** the code in proprietary software
✅ **Relicense** their derivatives (though they must include the original MIT license text)

### What Users Must Do

Users must only:
- Include a copy of the MIT License and copyright notice when distributing the code
- That's it! No other obligations.

### Alternative Licenses Considered

Other licenses that could work but are less ideal:

- **Apache 2.0**: Similar to MIT but includes explicit patent grant. Good choice but slightly more complex.
- **BSD-3-Clause**: Similar to MIT with an additional non-endorsement clause. Also acceptable.
- **GPL/AGPL**: Too restrictive for example code - would require users to open-source their modifications.
- **Proprietary/All Rights Reserved**: Would discourage adoption and defeat the purpose of examples.
- **Creative Commons**: Designed for creative works, not software. Could confuse legal teams.

### Relationship to Sonotheia API Service

**Important distinction:**
- This repository (examples and documentation): **MIT Licensed** - freely usable
- Sonotheia API service: **Commercial/Proprietary** - requires API key and subscription
- Users can freely use these examples, but must separately obtain authorization to use the Sonotheia API itself

The MIT license applies only to the example code and documentation in this repository, not to the Sonotheia API service or any intellectual property of Sonotheia.ai.

### Recommendations

**For Repository Maintainers:**
- ✅ **Keep the MIT License** - it's the right choice for this repository
- ✅ Ensure copyright notice is up to date in the LICENSE file
- ✅ Keep the clarification in README.md that the license applies to examples, not the API service
- ✅ No changes needed unless you have specific requirements (e.g., patent protection needs)

**For Users:**
- Read and understand the LICENSE file
- Include the license notice when redistributing code
- Remember that API access requires separate authorization from Sonotheia
- These are examples, not guaranteed production-ready code - test thoroughly!

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I use these examples in my commercial product?**
A: Yes! The MIT License explicitly permits commercial use.

**Q: Do I need to open-source my modifications?**
A: No. MIT License does not require you to share your modifications.

**Q: Can I remove the copyright notice?**
A: No. You must include the original copyright notice and license text.

**Q: Does this license give me rights to the Sonotheia API?**
A: No. This license only covers the example code in this repository. API access requires separate authorization.

**Q: What if I find a bug or want to contribute improvements?**
A: Contributions are welcome! Submit a pull request. Your contributions will also be under the MIT License.

### Summary

**The MIT License is the correct choice for this repository.** It provides maximum flexibility for users while maintaining appropriate protections for the repository owner. No changes are recommended unless you have specific legal requirements that necessitate a different license.
